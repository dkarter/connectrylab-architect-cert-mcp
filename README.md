## What is Architect Cert?

Architect Cert is a free, open-source [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that turns Claude into your personal certification tutor for the **Claude Certified Architect — Foundations** exam. No courses, no slides, no video lectures — just ask Claude and study.

It ships with:

- **390 scenario-based questions** across all 5 exam domains and 30 task statements
- **Interactive clickable UI** — answer questions with A/B/C/D buttons, select follow-ups, pick domains with checkboxes — all inside Claude
- **Lessons-first assessment** — learn each domain's concepts before being tested on them
- **Guided capstone build** — shape your own project, then build it step-by-step while learning every task statement hands-on
- **30 concept handouts** — one per task statement, with code examples and common mistakes
- **6 reference projects** — runnable TypeScript codebases demonstrating each domain in practice
- **Practice exams** — 60-question weighted exams with history tracking and improvement trends
- **Progress dashboard** — glassmorphism visual dashboard with mastery levels, exam history chart, activity timeline
- **Visual progress tracking** — todo checklists track your progress through assessments, exams, and capstone builds in real time
- **Interactive follow-ups** — wrong answer? Click to see code examples, concept lessons, handouts, or reference projects
- **PDF generation** — branded handout PDFs with the Architect Cert logo for offline study
- **Spaced repetition** — SM-2 algorithm schedules reviews at optimal intervals
- **Deterministic grading** — pure function grading, no LLM judgment, zero sycophancy

Everything runs locally. No cloud, no accounts, no telemetry.

<br />

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install -g connectry-architect-mcp
```

### 2. Configure Your MCP Client

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code</b> — One-liner</summary>

```bash
claude mcp add connectry-architect -- connectry-architect-mcp
```

That's it. Restart Claude Code and the server starts automatically.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code</b> — Manual config</summary>

Add to `.mcp.json` in your project or `~/.claude.json` globally:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "connectry-architect": {
      "command": "connectry-architect-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code. The server starts automatically when Claude loads.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Desktop</b> — macOS</summary>

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "connectry-architect": {
      "command": "connectry-architect-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Tip:** If you use `nvm`, you may need to specify the full path to the binary:
>
> ```json
> "command": "/Users/yourname/.nvm/versions/node/v22.20.0/bin/connectry-architect-mcp"
> ```

Restart Claude Desktop. You'll see the MCP tools icon appear in the chat input.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Desktop</b> — Docker (no local npm install)</summary>

Pull the image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/dkarter/connectrylab-architect-cert-mcp:latest
```

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "connectry-architect": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-v",
        "/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/.local/share/connectry-architect:/root/.connectry-architect",
        "ghcr.io/dkarter/connectrylab-architect-cert-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This runs the server in an isolated container with no npm dependencies on your machine. Your progress is persisted via the volume mount at `~/.local/share/connectry-architect`.

Restart Claude Desktop. You'll see the MCP tools icon appear in the chat input.

### 3. Start Studying

Restart your MCP client and start chatting:

| What you want               | What to ask Claude                                   |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Start from scratch          | _"Start an assessment to figure out where I stand"_  |
| Practice questions          | _"Give me a practice question"_                      |
| Focus on a domain           | _"Give me a question about agentic architecture"_    |
| Learn a concept first       | _"Teach me about task 2.3 — tool provisioning"_      |
| Build your own capstone     | _"I want to start a guided capstone build"_          |
| Take a practice exam        | _"I want to take a practice exam"_                   |

| Reset and start over        | _"Reset my progress"_                                |

<br />

## Learning Path

Architect Cert is designed to follow a natural progression. Here's the recommended order:

```
1. Assessment        → Baseline your knowledge across all 5 domains
       ↓
2. Learn concepts    → Read handouts for weak domains before practicing
       ↓
3. Adaptive practice → Questions prioritized by weakness, reviews, new material
       ↓
4. Follow-ups        → Dive into code examples, concept lessons, reference projects
       ↓
5. Capstone build    → Build your own project covering all 30 task statements
       ↓
6. Practice exams    → Simulate the real exam (60 questions, scored out of 1000)
       ↓
7. Review & repeat   → Dashboard tracks mastery, spaced repetition handles scheduling
```

You can jump to any stage at any time — the system adapts. But the path above gives you the most structured experience.

<br />

## Interactive Experience

Architect Cert uses Claude's built-in interactive UI to make studying feel natural. No typing answer letters — just click.

### Clickable Answer Selection

Every question presents **clickable A/B/C/D buttons** directly in Claude. You tap your answer instead of typing it. If the question includes code in the scenario, a **code preview** appears alongside each option so you can reference it while deciding.

### Follow-Up Actions

After every answer, clickable follow-up buttons appear:

**After a wrong answer:**

- Got it, next question
- Explain with a code example
- Show me the concept lesson
- Show me the handout
- Show me in the reference project

**After a correct answer:**

- Next question
- Explain why the others are wrong

### Multi-Select Domain Picker

When requesting a study plan, you can select multiple domains to focus on using **checkboxes** — no need to list them out by name.

### Visual Progress Checklists

Long flows like the assessment (15 questions), practice exams (60 questions), and capstone build (18 steps) create a **visual todo checklist** that updates in real time as you progress. You always know where you are and what's left.

### Skip & Other

Every question selection includes a **Skip** button to move on and an **Other** option to ask a free-form question. If you use "Other" to ask something, Claude answers your question and then **re-presents the same quiz question** — you never lose your place. "Skip" moves to the next question; skipped questions remain unanswered and will reappear later.

<br />

## Initial Assessment

Start with a **15-question diagnostic** (3 per domain) that determines your learning path. The assessment works differently from raw practice:

### Lessons-First Flow

When the assessment reaches a **new domain** for the first time, it pauses to show you the **concept handout** before asking questions. This means you learn the key ideas, see code examples, and understand common mistakes _before_ being tested — no guessing blindly.

The flow for each domain:

1. Concept handout is shown (one-time per domain)
2. 3 questions presented one at a time (easy, medium, hard)
3. Each answer graded immediately with explanation
4. Move to the next domain

### Path Assignment

Based on your overall accuracy:

| Score      | Path              | Description                                                                                             |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **< 60%**  | Beginner-Friendly | Starts with fundamentals, builds up gradually. Focuses on easy and medium questions first.              |
| **>= 60%** | Exam-Weighted     | Focuses on high-weight domains first (D1 at 27%, D3 & D4 at 20% each). Targets weak areas aggressively. |

### Progress Tracking

The assessment creates a **15-item visual checklist** (Q1 through Q15, grouped by domain) that updates after each answer. You always see exactly how far you've progressed.

<br />

## Concept Handouts

Every task statement has a **concept handout** — a structured study document (~500-800 words) that covers:

- **Concept** — The core idea, mental model, and when/why to use it
- **Code Example** — Realistic TypeScript demonstrating the pattern
- **Common Mistakes** — The 3-5 most frequent errors (which map to exam wrong answers)
- **References** — Links to Anthropic's official documentation

### Reading Handouts in Claude

```
You: "Show me the handout for task 2.3"

Claude: [loads the full handout with concept, code, mistakes, references]
```

### When Handouts Appear Automatically

- **During assessment** — shown before the first question of each new domain
- **After a wrong answer** — "Show me the handout" is one of the follow-up options
- **During capstone build** — relevant handouts are available at each build step

### Generating PDF Handouts

Generate branded PDFs for all 30 handouts for offline study:

```bash
cd connectrylab-architect-cert-mcp
npm run generate:pdfs
```

This creates 30 PDFs in `generated/handouts/` with:

- Architect Cert logo and domain label in the header
- Clean formatting with syntax-highlighted code blocks
- "Connectry LABS — Claude Certified Architect Exam Prep — Free & Open Source" footer

<br />

## Adaptive Practice

Every practice question is selected by a **three-priority algorithm**:

1. **Overdue reviews** — Spaced repetition items due for review today
2. **Weak areas** — Topics where your mastery is below 50%
3. **New material** — Fresh questions from your recommended domain

### Filtering

You can filter practice questions by domain and/or difficulty:

```
You: "Give me a hard question about prompt engineering"

Claude: [presents a hard Domain 4 question with clickable A/B/C/D buttons]
```

### Interactive Follow-Ups

After every answer, you get clickable follow-up options. Each option dives deeper into the concept — then brings you right back to your quiz. You never leave your study flow to look something up.

### Mastery Levels

Each of the 30 task statements has an independent mastery level:

| Level          | Criteria                                             | What it means                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unassessed** | No attempts yet                                      | You haven't seen questions on this topic                 |
| **Weak**       | < 50% accuracy                                       | Needs significant study — questions resurface frequently |
| **Developing** | 50-69% accuracy                                      | Making progress — keep practicing                        |
| **Strong**     | 70-89% accuracy                                      | Good understanding — review intervals are longer         |
| **Mastered**   | >= 90% accuracy, 5+ attempts, 3+ consecutive correct | Exam-ready — rare reviews                                |

### Spaced Repetition (SM-2)

The [SM-2 algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo#Description_of_SM-2_algorithm) schedules review intervals:

- **First review:** 1 day after answering
- **Second review:** 3 days after first review
- **Subsequent reviews:** Previous interval x ease factor (starts at 2.5)
- **Wrong answer:** Interval resets, ease factor decreases by 0.2 (floor: 1.3)
- **Correct answer:** Ease factor increases by 0.1

Difficult questions come back often. Easy ones space out to weeks or months.

<br />

## Guided Capstone Build

The most hands-on way to learn — build your own project from scratch while covering all 30 task statements. Instead of just answering questions, you architect a real system themed to your own idea.

### How It Works

The capstone build has three phases:

**Phase 1 — Project Shaping**

You describe a project idea (e.g., "a multi-agent code review system"). Claude analyzes your idea against all 30 architectural criteria and identifies gaps. You refine together until every task statement is covered.

```
You: "I want to start a guided capstone build"

Claude: [presents the 30 criteria across all 5 domains]
        Describe your project idea and I'll analyze coverage.

You: "A multi-agent code review system that analyzes PRs"

Claude: Your idea naturally covers 24/30 criteria. To cover the
        remaining 6, I'd suggest adding: [specific suggestions
        mapped to task statements]
```

**Phase 2 — Interleaved Build (18 steps)**

Each step follows the same pattern:

1. **Quiz** — 2-3 questions on the task statements you're about to build (clickable A/B/C/D)
2. **Build** — Claude generates the file's code, themed to your project
3. **Walkthrough** — Line-by-line explanation mapping code to task statements

A **visual 18-step checklist** tracks your progress in real time.

The 18 steps build incrementally:

| Steps | What you build                                                       | Task Statements |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1-2   | Project config (CLAUDE.md, package.json)                             | 3.1-3.4         |
| 3-5   | MCP server, tools, error handling                                    | 2.1-2.5         |
| 6-10  | Agentic loop, subagents, hooks, workflows, sessions                  | 1.1-1.7         |
| 11-13 | Prompts: system, extraction, batch processing                        | 4.1-4.6         |
| 14-18 | Context: preservation, triggers, propagation, scratchpad, confidence | 5.1-5.6         |

Every quiz answer feeds into the same spaced repetition and mastery tracking as regular practice.

**Phase 3 — Final Review**

After step 18, you get a complete coverage map: all 30 task statements, where each is demonstrated in your project, and your quiz performance per domain. Weak areas are flagged for further study.

### Capstone Build Tools

| Tool                    | What it does                                                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start_capstone_build`  | See the 30 criteria, describe your theme, refine until coverage is complete |
| `capstone_build_step`   | Drive the build: confirm, quiz, build, next, status, or abandon             |
| `capstone_build_status` | Check your progress — current step, criteria coverage, quiz performance     |

### How It Connects to Everything Else

- Quiz answers during the build use the same `submit_answer` grading and SM-2 scheduling
- After any quiz question, you can use the same follow-up options (code example, concept lesson, handout, reference project)
- The reference projects show how the capstone structure looks when complete
- Progress persists across sessions — pick up where you left off

<br />

## Practice Exams

Full 60-question exams that simulate the real certification:

| Detail                    | Value                                                           |

All attempts are saved with per-domain score breakdowns and improvement trends.

<br />

## Progress Dashboard

Architect Cert includes a **glassmorphism visual dashboard** that renders directly inside Claude via Claude Preview.

### What It Shows

- **Readiness Ring** — Overall exam readiness percentage in a circular progress indicator
- **Domain Mastery Grid** — 5 cards with progress bars for each exam domain
- **Exam History Chart** — Line chart plotting your practice exam scores over time, with the 720 passing score marked
- **Recent Activity Timeline** — Your last 10 answers with correct/incorrect indicators
- **Capstone Progress** — Current build step and completion percentage
- **Quick Action Buttons** — Jump to practice, exam, study plan, or capstone

### How to Open

```
You: "Show my dashboard"

Claude: [opens the branded dashboard in Claude Preview]
```

The dashboard can be reopened at any time by asking Claude again. It always reflects your latest data.

### Text Fallback

For MCP clients that don't support Claude Preview, the dashboard tool also returns a **text summary** with mastery percentages and exam stats.

<br />

## Reference Projects

Architect Cert includes **6 complete reference projects** — runnable TypeScript codebases that demonstrate certification concepts in real code. Every file has a header comment mapping it to specific task statements.

| Project                     | Focus         | Files | What You'll See                                                                                                                                 |

| **D5 — Context Manager**    | Domain 5      | 14    | Long-session patterns: context preservation, scratchpad, subagent delegation, escalation, error propagation, confidence calibration, provenance |

### How to Access

```
You: "Show me a reference project for domain 1"

Claude: [returns the project README, file listing, and architecture walkthrough]
```

### How They Connect to the Study Flow

When you get a question wrong, one of the follow-up options is **"Show me in the reference project"** — this takes you straight to the relevant domain project so you can see the concept implemented in real code. Then you jump back to your quiz.

## Study Plan

Get personalized study recommendations based on your performance, exam weights, and spaced repetition schedule.

### Multi-Select Domain Focus

When requesting a study plan, you can pick specific domains to focus on using **checkboxes**:

```
You: "What should I study next?"

Claude: [shows domain checkboxes — select the ones you want to focus on]
        [generates a personalized study plan with a visual checklist]
```

The study plan creates a **visual checklist** so you can track your progress through each recommendation.

### Core Components

| Component             | Technology                     | Purpose                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| MCP Server            | `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` v1 | Registers tools, prompts, resources over stdio      |
| Grading Engine        | Pure TypeScript functions      | Deterministic answer verification                   |
| Spaced Repetition     | SM-2 algorithm                 | Optimal review scheduling                           |
| Question Selector     | Three-priority algorithm       | Overdue reviews > weak areas > new material         |
| Follow-Up System      | State-driven tool chain        | Interactive post-answer detours                     |
| Capstone Build Engine | 18-step interleaved builder    | Guided learn-build-explain flow with LLM validation |
| Dashboard Server      | Node.js HTTP + HTML            | Glassmorphism visual dashboard via Claude Preview   |
| Question Bank         | 390 bundled JSON questions     | Scenario-based, verified against docs               |
| Concept Handouts      | 30 bundled markdown files      | Structured study materials per task statement       |
| Reference Projects    | 6 bundled TypeScript projects  | Runnable code demonstrating each domain             |

| Progress Store        | `better-sqlite3` (WAL mode)    | Persistent mastery, answers, schedules              |

### Interactive UI Architecture

Architect Cert doesn't build its own chat UI. Instead, it instructs Claude to use **built-in interactive tools**:

- **AskUserQuestion** — Presents clickable buttons for A/B/C/D answers, follow-up actions, and domain selection. Supports single-select (radio buttons), multi-select (checkboxes), and free-text input via "Other".
- **TodoWrite** — Creates visual progress checklists that update in real time during assessments, exams, and capstone builds.
- **Claude Preview** — Renders the glassmorphism dashboard HTML on a local HTTP server.

This approach works across Claude Code and Claude Desktop without requiring any custom UI code on the client side.

### Anti-Sycophancy Design

This server enforces honest grading at the protocol level — not just in prompts:

1. **Deterministic grading** — `gradeAnswer()` is a pure function. No LLM is involved in judging correctness.
2. **Tool-level enforcement** — The `submit_answer` tool description instructs Claude to relay results verbatim.
3. **No partial credit** — Multiple choice, one correct answer. No "you were on the right track."
4. **Wrong answer explanations** — Every incorrect option has a specific `whyWrongMap` entry explaining the misconception.
5. **System prompt rules** — Five anti-sycophancy directives prevent Claude from softening incorrect results.

<br />

## Data Storage

- Progress is stored locally at `~/.connectry-architect/progress.db` (SQLite, WAL mode)
- Your user config lives at `~/.connectry-architect/config.json` (auto-created on first run)
- When running via Docker, both files are stored in the mounted volume (e.g. `~/.local/share/connectry-architect/`)
- No cloud, no accounts, no telemetry — everything stays on your machine
